Our previous studies found its regulation to myeloid immune cells, including macrophages. Aberrant infiltration and functions of macrophages are commonly found in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we analyzed the effects of fucoidan on invasion of OSCC cells, and their regulation to macrophages, trying to evaluate its role as a potential therapy for OSCC. CAL27 and THP-1-derived macrophages were used as models for OSCC cells and tumor-infiltrated macrophages in the in vitro study, respectively. The effects of fucoidan on invasion of OSCC cells and their recruitment to macrophages were analyzed by transwell assay. KIF4A siRNA transfection was performed to investigate its role in fucoidan-modulated OSCC cells invasion. CCL3-neutralizing antibody was added into the conditioned medium of OSCC cells to evaluate its role in fucoidan-mediated macrophages recruitment and re-education. Fucoidan reduced the invasive potential of CAL27 cells with a decrease of MMP-2 and KIF4A transcription. KIF4A knockdown in CAL27 cells led to decreased invasion and MMP-2 expression. The conditioned medium of fucoidan-treated CAL27 cells promoted recruitment and inflammatory cytokines secretion on THP-1-derived macrophages. Further analysis found that fucoidan increased CCL3 production in CAL27 cells. Blocking CCL3 expression reversed the effects of fucoidan on macrophage recruitment and re-education. Our study found that fucoidan regulated the invasion of OSCC cells and also their recruiting and re-educating effects on macrophages, suggesting it could be a complementary approach in the treatment of OSCC.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12032-016-0858-1']

RNA interference (RNAi) is a cellular process through harnessing a natural pathway silencing target gene based on recognition and subsequent degradation of specific mRNA sequences. It opens a promising approach for precision medicine. However, this application was hampered by many obstacles, such as immunogenicity, instability, toxicity problems, and difficulty in across the biological membrane. In this study, we reprogrammed urine exfoliated renal epithelial cells into human induced pluripotent stem cells (huiPSCs) and purified the exosomes (Exo) from huiPSCs as RNAi delivery system. Through choosing the episomal system to deliver transcription factors, we obtained a non-integrating huiPSCs. Experiments in both vitro and vivo demonstrated that these huiPSCs possess the pluripotent properties. The exosomes of huiPSCs isolated by differential centrifugation were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showing a typical exosomal appearance with an average diameter of 122 nm. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of the typical exosomal markers, including CD63, TSG 101, and Alix. Co-cultured PKH26-labeled exosomes with human primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) confirmed that they could be internalized by recipient cells at a time-dependent manner. Then, electroporation was used to introduce siRNA against intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) into exosomes to form an Exo/siRNA compound. The Exo/siRNA compound efficiently delivered the target siRNA into HMVECs causing selective gene silencing, inhibiting the ICAM-1 protein expression, and PMN-EC adhesion induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggest that huiPSCs exosomes could be used as a natural gene delivery vector to transport therapeutic siRNAs for alleviating inflammatory responses in recipient cells.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10753-016-0494-0']

However, little is known about its effect on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, including imatinib-resistant CML cells. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CTD could overcome imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant CML cells and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms associated with the effect. Our results showed that CTD strongly inhibited the growth of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. CTD induced cell cycle arrest at mitotic phase and triggered DNA damage in CML cells. The ATM/ATR inhibitor CGK733 abrogated CTD-induced mitotic arrest but promoted the cytotoxic effects of CTD. In addition, we demonstrated that CTD downregulated the expression of the BCR-ABL protein and suppressed its downstream signal transduction. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that CTD inhibited BCR-ABL at transcriptional level. Knockdown of BCR-ABL increased the cell-killing effects of CTD in K562 cells. These findings indicated that CTD overcomes imatinib resistance through depletion of BCRABL.

Genetics,"[<abstracttext>Utilizing massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology for SNP testing in forensic genetics is becoming attractive because of the shortcomings of STR markers, such as their high mutation rates and disadvantages associated with the current PCR-CE method as well as its limitations regarding multiplex capabilities. MPS offers the potential to genotype hundreds to thousands of SNPs from multiple samples in a single experimental run. In this study, we designed a customized SNP panel that includes 273 forensically relevant identity SNPs chosen from SNPforID, IISNP, and the HapMap database as well as previously related studies and evaluated the levels of genotyping precision, sequence coverage, sensitivity and SNP performance using the Ion Torrent PGM. In a concordant study of the custom MPS-SNP panel, only four MPS callings were missing due to coverage reads that were too low (&lt;20), whereas the others were fully concordant with Sanger's sequencing results across the two control samples, that is, 9947A and 9948. The analyses indicated a balanced coverage among the included loci, with the exception of the 16 SNPs that were used to detect an inconsistent allele balance and/or lower coverage reads among 50 tested individuals from the Chinese HAN population and the above controls. With the exception of the 16 poorly performing SNPs, the sequence coverage obtained was extensive for the bulk of the SNPs, and only three Y-SNPs (rs16980601, rs11096432, rs3900) showed a mean coverage below 1000. Analyses of the dilution series of control DNA 9948 yielded reproducible results down to 1ng of DNA input. In addition, we provide an analysis tool for automated data quality control and genotyping checks, and we conclude that the SNP targets are polymorphic and independent in the Chinese HAN population. In summary, the evaluation of the sensitivity, accuracy and genotyping performance provides strong support for the application of MPS technology in forensic SNP analysis, and the assay offers a straightforward sample-to-genotype workflow that could be beneficial in forensic casework with respect to both individual identification and complex kinship issues.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1872-4973(16)30232-0']

However, the efficient and safe delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 into specific cell populations is still the principal challenge in the clinical development of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics. In this study, a flexible aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimera was designed to combine efficient delivery and increased flexibility. Our chimera incorporated an RNA aptamer that specifically binds prostate cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen as a ligand. Cationic liposomes were linked to aptamers by the post-insertion method and were used to deliver therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 that target the survival gene, polo-like kinase 1, in tumor cells. We demonstrate that the aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimeras had a significant cell-type binding specificity and a remarkable gene silencing effect in vitro. Furthermore, silencing promoted a conspicuous regression of prostate cancer in vivo. Importantly, the approach described here provides a universal means of cell type-specific CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, which is a critical goal for the widespread therapeutic applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 or other nucleic acid drugs.</abstracttext>]",[]

Most patients are not diagnosed until the cancer is at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Notch1 signaling pathway plays an oncogenic role in EOC. There have been few studies on enzymatic activity of γ-secretase and the mechanism of how γ-secretase inhibitor works on cancer cell. Here, we show that Jagged1 and NICD were highly expressed in ovarian carcinoma. The expressions of Notch1, Jagged1 and NICD in Notch1 pathway did not correlate with outcome in ovarian cancer. The enzymatic activity of γ-secretase in ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, CAOV3 and ES2 is significantly higher than in normal ovarian epithelial cell line T29. DAPT (a γ-secretase inhibitor) reduced the enzymatic activity of γ-secretase, inhibited the proliferation, and increased the apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines. Hence, γ-secretase inhibitor may become a highly promising novel therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer in the field of precision medicine.</abstracttext>]",[]

The lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is upregulated in bladder cancer and promotes the progression of bladder cancer. Here, we design gRNAs specific to UCA1 and construct CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting UCA1. Single CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1 can effectively inhibit UCA1 expression when transfected into 5637 and T24 bladder cancer cells, while the combined transfection of the two most effective CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1s can generate more satisfied inhibitory effect. CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1s attenuate UCA1 expression via targeted genome-specific DNA cleavage, resulting in the significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms associated with the inhibitory effect of CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1 on malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer are attributed to the induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, a substantial increase of apoptosis, and an enhanced activity of MMPs. Additionally, urinary UCA1 can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for bladder cancer as revealed by a meta-analysis. Collectively, our data suggest that CRISPR/Cas9 technique can be used to down-modulate lncRNA expression, and urinary UCA1 may be used as a non-invasive marker for diagnosis of bladder cancer.</abstracttext>]",[]

N-cadherin, a well-known EMT marker, acts as a major oncogene in diverse cancers, whereas its functions in thyroid cancer remains largely unclear. This study was designed to explore the biological roles and related molecular mechanism of N-cadherin in thyroid tumorigenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry assays were used to evaluate N-cadherin expression. A series of in vitro studies such as cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays were performed to determine the effect of N-cadherin on malignant behavior of thyroid cancer cells. Our results showed that N-cadherin was significantly upregulated in papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) as compared with non-cancerous thyroid tissues. N-cadherin knockdown markedly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration and invasion, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. On the other hand, ectopic expression of N-cadherin promoted thyroid cancer cell growth and invasiveness. Mechanically, our data demonstrated that tumor-promoting role of N-cadherin in thyroid cancer was closely related to the activities of the MAPK/Erk, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p16/Rb signaling pathways in addition to affecting the EMT process. Altogether, our findings suggest that N-cadherin promotes thyroid tumorigenesis by modulating the activities of major signaling pathways and EMT process, and may represent a potential therapeutic target for this cancer.</abstracttext>]",[]

Currently, no standard method has been developed to precisely assess the therapeutic response of bone metastases (BM) and the early efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy, which does not conform to the concept of precision medicine. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for precise evaluation of the response to chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic agents in NSCLC patients with BM. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (vinorelbine + cisplatin [NP] + recombinant human endostatin [rh-endostatin]) or a control group (NP + placebo). All patients were evaluated before treatment and after 2 cycles of treatment using DCE-MRI quantitative analysis technology for BM lesions and chest computed tomography (CT). Correlations between changes in the DCE-MRI quantitative parameters and treatment effect were analyzed. We enrolled 33 patients, of whom 28 were evaluable (20 in the treatment group and 8 in the control group). The results suggested a higher objective response rate (30% vs. 0%), better overall survival (21.44 ± 17.28 months vs. 7.71 ± 4.68 months), and a greater decrease in the transport constant (Ktrans) value (60% vs. 4.4%) in the treatment group than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

Smad-dependent canonical BMP signaling pathway is indispensable for osteoblastic bone formation, which could be disrupted by the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Smad1/5, the key molecules for BMP signaling transduction. However, whether the dysregulation of Smad1/5 ubiquitination and disrupted BMP signaling pathway is responsible for the age-related bone formation reduction is still underexplored. Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1 (PLEKHO1) is a previously identified ubiquitination-related molecule that could specifically target the linker region between the WW domains of Smurf1 to promote the ubiquitination of Smad1/5. Here, we found an age-related increase in the expression of PLEKHO1 in bone specimens from either fractured patients or aging rodents, which was associated with the age-related reduction in Smad-dependent BMP signaling and bone formation. By genetic approach, we demonstrated that loss of Plekho1 in osteoblasts could promote the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and alleviated the age-related bone formation reduction. In addition, osteoblast-specific Smad1 overexpression had beneficial effect on bone formation during aging, which could be counteracted after overexpressing Plekho1 within osteoblasts. By pharmacological approach, we showed that osteoblast-targeted Plekho1 siRNA treatment could enhance Smad-dependent BMP signaling and promote bone formation in aging rodents. Taken together, it suggests that the increased PLEKHO1 could suppress Smad-dependent BMP signaling to inhibit bone formation during aging, indicating the translational potential of targeting PLEKHO1 in osteoblast as a novel bone anabolic strategy for reversing established osteoporosis during aging.</abstracttext>]",[]

We addressed this issue by an integrative genomics approach to compare mRNA expression between AS and CA cases of breast cancer.

Increased susceptibility and severity in CA patients were likely the result of synergistic environmental and genetic risk factors, with arachidonic acid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathways implicated in linking environmental and genetic factors. An analysis that also added eQTL data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and SNP data from the 1,000 Genomes Project identified several SNPs associated with differentially expressed genes.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic links between diet and particular oncogenic mutations in human cancers remain unclear. We recently reported that the ketone body acetoacetate selectively enhances BRAF V600E mutant-dependent MEK1 activation in human cancers. Here we show that a high-fat ketogenic diet increased serum levels of acetoacetate, leading to enhanced tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in xenograft mice. Treatment with hypolipidemic agents to lower circulating acetoacetate levels or an inhibitory homolog of acetoacetate, dehydroacetic acid, to antagonize acetoacetate-BRAF V600E binding attenuated BRAF V600E tumor growth. These findings reveal a signaling basis underlying a pathogenic role of dietary fat in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma, providing insights into the design of conceptualized ""precision diets"" that may prevent or delay tumor progression based on an individual's specific oncogenic mutation profile.</abstracttext>]",['https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550-4131(16)30643-X']

However, life-threatening myelotoxicity has been noticed and largely explained by genetic variations, including NUDT15 polymorphisms (e.g., rs116855232). In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of rs116855232 on thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity susceptibility (1752 patients from 7 independent cohorts), as well as on thiopurines intolerance dose (2745 patients from 13 cohorts). Variant allele of rs116855232 contributes 7.86-fold (P &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI: 6.13-10.08) higher risk to develop leucopenia with high specificity (91.74%) and sensitivity (43.19%), and lower thiopurines intolerance dose (P &lt; 0.00001). Through bioinformatics prediction, amino acid changes induced by genetic variants are considered to reduce the stability, and break an α helix of NUDT15, which is part of the thiopurine binding pocket. Additionally, we conduct an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis for NUDT15, and find a promoter-located eQTL signal (rs554405994), which may act as a potential marker to predict thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in NUDT15 are strongly associated with adverse drug reaction (ADR) of thiopurines, although more evidences are needed to determine values of all functional NUDT15 polymorphisms for clinical regimen, rs116855232 should be considered as a highly credible pharmacogenetic indicator for thiopurines using espcially is Asians.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/misc/linkedout.php?pii=14594']

We carefully selected 285 genes with in vivo evidence of promoting metastasis reported in the literature. These genes have been investigated in different tumor types. We used two datasets downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, specifically, datasets of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, for validation tests, and excluded any genes for which elevated expression level correlated with longer overall survival in any of the datasets.

Here, we found that the highly expressed CKIP-1 together with lowly expressed total and phosphorylated Smad1/5 in bone samples was accompanied by either the reduced serum bone formation markers in GIO patients or the decreased bone formation in GIO mice. In vitro studies showed that the highly expressed CKIP-1 could promote Smad1 ubiquitination to suppress the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and inhibit osteogenic differentiation and mineral deposition in MC3T3-E1 cells during glucocorticoid treatment. Further, the reduced bone formation in GIO mice could not only be prevented by osteoblasts-specific Ckip-1 ablation, but also be attenuated after osteoblasts-specific Smad1 overexpression. Moreover, osteoblasts-targeting CKIP-1 siRNA treatment also attenuated the bone formation reduction in GIO mice. These study suggest that the highly expressed CKIP-1 in osteoblasts could suppress the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and contribute to the bone formation reduction in GIO. Targeting osteoblastic CKIP-1 would be a novel bone anabolic strategy for GIO patients.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep41295']

Accentuating endogenous energy expenditure has been accorded considerable attention ever since the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans was recognized, given that BAT is known to increase energy expenditure via thermogenesis. Besides classic BAT, significant strides in our understanding of inducible brown adipocytes have been made regarding its development and function. While it is ideal to study BAT histologically, its relatively inaccessible anatomical locations and the inherent risks associated with biopsy preclude invasive techniques to evaluate BAT on a routine basis. Thus, there has been a surge in interest to employ non-invasive methods to examine BAT. The gold standard of non-invasive detection of BAT activation is <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT). However, a major limitation of PET/CT as a tool for human BAT studies is the clinically significant doses of ionizing radiation. More recently, several other imaging methods, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), infrared thermography (IRT)/thermal imaging and contrast ultrasonography (US) have been developed in hopes that they would allow non-invasive, quantitative measures of BAT mass and activity with lower costs. This review focuses on such methods to detect human BAT activation and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning to prompt the establishment of BAT-centric strategies for augmenting energy expenditure and combatting obesity.

Against the background of maternal DNA, the use of the relatively low concentration of cff DNA is limited in NIPD. Therefore, in order to overcome the complication of the background of maternal DNA and expand the scope of cff DNA application in clinical practice, it is necessary to identify novel universal fetal‑specific DNA markers.

Aptamers are a class of small ligands composed of single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind to their targets with high affinity and specificity. In this study, we identified an ssDNA aptamer specifically targeting Maver-1 lymphoma cells with high binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 70±8 pmol/L). Interestingly, cellular cycle studies revealed that exposure of Maver-1 cells to synthetic aptamers triggered S-phase arrest of 40% of the cells (vs. 18% baseline). Confocal microscopy confirmed specific cell binding of aptamers and the resultant endocytosis into Maver-1 cells. Subsequent functional assays validated the fact that aptamer internalization into targeted cells is a prerequisite for Maver-1 cell growth inhibition. Importantly, aptamer-induced S-phase arrest induced enhanced chemotherapeutic results involving cytarabine, which primarily kills lymphoma cells at S-phase. Combination treatments revealed that aptamer re-exposure considerably primed Maver-1 cells for cytarabine chemotherapy, thus achieving a synergistic killing effect by reaching cell death rates as high as 61% (vs. 13% or 14% induced by aptamer or cytarabine treatment alone). These findings demonstrated that aptamers do not only act as molecular ligands but can also function as biotherapeutic agents by inducing S-phase arrest of lymphoma cells.

To optimize the neuroprotective efficacy of BMMSCs further, in this study we have derived BMMSCs, which co-overexpress both BDNF and VEGF, and tested them for the treatment of CA-GCII in a rat model. Lentiviruses that express rat BDNF exon IV or VEGF-A were created using the bicistronic shuttle vectors of pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 and pLVX-IRES-tdTomato, respectively. BMMSCs that were co-transduced with the engineered lentiviruses with co-overexpression of both BDNF and VEGF along with corresponding fluorescent protein reporters were injected via jugular vein of rats that just recovered from a cardiac arrest.

Ras activation in cancer cells drives protein internalization via macropinocytosis as a key nutrient-gaining process.

Apolipoprotein E3-reconstituted high-density lipoprotein is used to encapsulate the siRNA-loaded calcium phosphate core and facilitate it to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, thus targeting the glioblastoma cells in a macropinocytosis-dependent manner. The nanostructure carrying ATF5 siRNA exerts remarkable RNA-interfering efficiency, increases glioblastoma cell apoptosis and inhibits tumour cell growth both in vitro and in xenograft tumour models.

Lung cancer of never smokers exhibited significantly higher ctDNA mutation rates as well as higher EGFR and ERBB2 mutations than ever smokers. Comparative analysis of ctDNA and tumor DNA mutation data from the same patients showed that key driver mutations could be detected in plasma even when they were present at a minor clonal population in the tumor.

Little evidence was found to support a negative long-term effect of initial or maintenance antipsychotic treatment on outcomes, compared with withholding treatment. Randomized controlled trials strongly support the efficacy of antipsychotics for the acute treatment of psychosis and prevention of relapse; correlational evidence suggests that early intervention and reduced duration of untreated psychosis might improve longer-term outcomes.

Life sciences,"[<abstracttext>Humans have been exposed to many environmental challenges since their evolutionary origins in Africa and subsequent migrations to the rest of the world. A severe environmental challenge to human migrants was hypoxia caused by low barometric oxygen pressure at high altitudes. Several genome-wide scans have elucidated the genetic basis of human high-altitude adaptations. However, the dearth of functional variant information has led to the successful association of only a few candidate genes. In the present study, we employed a candidate gene approach and re-sequenced the EDAR locus in 45 Tibetan individuals to identify mutations involved in hypoxia adaptation. We identified 10 and five quantitative trait-associated mutations for oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and blood platelet count, respectively, at the EDAR locus. Among these, rs10865026 and rs3749110 (associated with SaO<sub>2</sub> and platelet count, respectively) were identified as functional candidate targets.

The dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor to distant sites through the bloodstream cannot be detected early by standard imaging methods. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent an effective prognostic and predictive biomarker, which are able to monitor efficacy of adjuvant therapies, detect early development of metastases, and finally, assess therapeutic responses of advanced disease earlier than traditional diagnostic methods. In addition, since repeated tissue biopsies are invasive, costly and not always feasible, the assessment of tumor characteristics on CTCs, by a peripheral blood sample as a liquid biopsy, represents an attractive opportunity. The implementation of molecular and genomic characterization of CTCs may contribute to improve the treatment selection and thus, to move toward more precise diagnosis and therapy in PCa. The present study summarizes the current advances in CTC enrichment and detection strategies and reviews how CTCs may contribute to significant insights in the metastatic process, as well as how they may be utilized in clinical application in PCa. Although it is proposed that CTCs may offer insights into the prognosis and management of PCa, there are a number of challenges in the study of circulating tumor cells, and their clinical utility remains under investigation.</abstracttext>]",[]

Previously, we introduced two circadian hormones for trace deposition timing and recently demonstrated that messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers significantly improve time prediction accuracy. Here, we investigate the suitability of metabolites measured using a targeted metabolomics approach, for trace deposition timing. Analysis of 171 plasma metabolites collected around the clock at 2-h intervals for 36 h from 12 male participants under controlled laboratory conditions identified 56 metabolites showing statistically significant oscillations, with peak times falling into three day/night time categories: morning/noon, afternoon/evening and night/early morning. Time prediction modelling identified 10 independently contributing metabolite biomarkers, which together achieved prediction accuracies expressed as AUC of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.90 for these three time categories respectively. Combining metabolites with previously established hormone and mRNA biomarkers in time prediction modelling resulted in an improved prediction accuracy reaching AUCs of 0.85, 0.89 and 0.96 respectively. The additional impact of metabolite biomarkers, however, was rather minor as the previously established model with melatonin, cortisol and three mRNA biomarkers achieved AUC values of 0.88, 0.88 and 0.95 for the same three time categories respectively. Nevertheless, the selected metabolites could become practically useful in scenarios where RNA marker information is unavailable such as due to RNA degradation. This is the first metabolomics study investigating circulating metabolites for trace deposition timing, and more work is needed to fully establish their usefulness for this forensic purpose.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00414-017-1638-y']

The results demonstrated that 4bHWE modulates the alternative splicing of various apoptotic genes, including HIPK3, SMAC/DIABLO, and SURVIVIN. We also discovered that the levels of SRSF1 phospho-isoform were decreased and the levels of H3K36me3 were increased in 4bHWE treatment. Knockdown experiments revealed that the splicing site selection of SMAC/DIABLO could be mediated by changes in the level of H3K36me3 in 4bHWE-treated cells. Furthermore, we extended our study to apoptosis-associated molecules, and detected increased levels of poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage and the active form of CASPASE-3 in 4bHWE-induced apoptosis.

Subregions and curves connecting the edge points in the plane are obtained by imposing certain constraints on the IPP; consequently any point on the subregion indicates the information related to a decomposition of the Mueller matrix into its components as a convex sum.

Dozens of studies including ours have indicated that exogenous administration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could exert effective cognitive protection during ischemia. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism has not been well clarified. To address this issue, we explored the synaptic mechanisms in vivo since hippocampal synaptic function is essential to the learning and memory process. Besides, the role of autophagy in cognitive dysfunction under conditions of CCH is still controversial. And abnormal autophagy could threaten normal neurotransmission at synapse where a large amount of protein synthesis and degradation take place. Hence, we further examined whether the altered synaptic function was associated with autophagy. The results showed that CCH impaired spatial cognition as evidenced in Morris water maze. We further found that VEGF mitigated impaired hippocampal synaptic function including basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, short-term, long-term plasticity, depotentiation, and the level of synaptic proteins as assessed by electrophysiological examination and western blot assay. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that CCH could induce excessive autophagy which could be inhibited by VEGF. Thus, we speculated that VEGF could ameliorate impaired synaptic function induced by CCH because of its ability to inhibit excessive autophagy, and eventually improve spatial learning and memory function. Importantly, our findings shed light on potential therapeutic strategies to be exploited in the usage of VEGF.</abstracttext>]",['https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12017-017-8458-6']

However, its precise role in gastric cancer (GC) and the relevant molecular mechanism remain unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-638 levels were lower in GC tissues and GC cell lines than in adjacent normal tissues and normal gastric epithelial cell lines, respectively. Low miR-638 levels were associated with poor tumor differentiation, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. MeCP2 expression levels were higher in GC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. It was found that miR-638 inhibited GC cell proliferation, colony formation, G1-S transition and tumor growth, and induced cell apoptosis by directly targeting MeCP2. MeCP2 promoted GC cell proliferation, colony formation and G1-S cell-cycle transition, and suppressed apoptosis. Molecular mechanistic investigations were performed using an integrated approach with a combination of microarray analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and a reporter gene assay. The results showed that MeCP2 bound to the methylated CpG islands of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) promoter and upregulated its expression, thereby activating the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and promoting GC cell proliferation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that MeCP2, a target of miR-638, facilitates GC cell proliferation and induces cell-cycle progression through activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway by upregulating GIT1. The findings suggest that MeCP2 plays a significant role in GC progression, and may serve as a potential target for GC therapy.</abstracttext>]","['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oncsis.2017.60', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28759023/']"

BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3<sup>SPOP</sup> earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.</abstracttext>]",['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.4378']

Firstly, serial liquid-liquid extractions were utilized to prepare different batches of Callicarpa biochemome, and the preparation yields were utilized for the normalization of sampling quantity prior to UHPLC-IT-MS analysis. Secondly, 34 compounds, including 19 phenylethanoid glycosides, 10 flavonoids and 5 terpenoids, were identified based on an untargeted UHPLC-IT-MS method.

However, locating deep brain activities such as in the mesial temporal structures, especially in preoperative evaluation of epilepsy patients, may be more challenging. In this work we have proposed a modified beamforming approach for finding deep sources. First, an iterative spatiotemporal signal decomposition was employed for reconstructing the sensor arrays, which could characterize the intrinsic discriminant features for interpreting sensor signals. Next, a sensor covariance matrix was estimated under the new reconstructed space. Then, a well-known vector beamforming approach, which was a linearly constraint minimum variance (LCMV) approach, was applied to compute the solution for the inverse problem. It can be shown that the proposed source localization approach can give better localization accuracy than two other commonly-used beamforming methods (LCMV, MUSIC) in simulated MEG measurements generated with deep sources. Further, we applied the proposed approach to real MEG data recorded from ten patients with medically-refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) for finding epileptogenic zone(s), and there was a good agreement between those findings by the proposed approach and the clinical comprehensive results.</abstracttext>]",['http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s17081860']

However, there remains a geographical imbalance in genome-wide association studies, which to date have primarily focused on Western populations. During the last 6 years, genome-wide association studies in Han Chinese populations have identified both the sharing of susceptible loci across ethnicities and genes unique to Han Chinese populations. Here, we review recent progress in genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia in Han Chinese populations. Researchers have identified and replicated the sharing of susceptible genes, such as within the major histocompatibility complex, microRNA 137 (MIR137), zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A), vaccinia related kinase 2 (VRK2), and arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT), across both European and East Asian populations.

However, these studies have identified some potential confounding factors, such as genetic heterogeneity and the effects of natural selection on tetraspanin 18 (TSPAN18) or zinc finger protein 323 (ZNF323), which may explain the population differences in genome-wide association studies.

In the present study, we develop a peptide immunoaffinity enrichment-coupled multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SISCAPA-MRM) assay for verifying multiple reported oral cancer biomarkers in saliva. We successfully produced 363 clones of mouse anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against 36 of 49 selected targets, and characterized useful mAbs against 24 targets in terms of their binding affinity for peptide antigens and immuno-capture ability. Comparative analyses revealed that an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) cut-off value &amp;lt; 2.82&amp;nbsp;&amp;acute;&amp;nbsp;10-9 M could identify most clones with an immuno-capture recovery rate &amp;gt;5%.

It is unclear whether this association arises from local effects, such as increased hormone extractability, or whether the association represents systemic differences arising from population stratification. We tested the hypothesis that hair pigmentation gene variants are associated with varying cortisol levels independent of genetic ancestry. Hormone concentrations and genotype were measured in 1674 children from the Generation R cohort at age 6. We computed a polygenic score of hair color based on 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This score was used to predict hair cortisol concentrations, adjusted for genetic ancestry, sex, age and corticosteroid use. A 1-standard deviation (SD) higher polygenic score (darker hair) was associated with 0.08 SD higher cortisol levels (SE = 0.03, p = 0.002). This suggests that variation in hair cortisol concentrations is partly explained by local hair effects. In multi-ancestry studies this hair pigmentation bias can reduce power and confound results.

In order to test whether specific CpG sites of <i>ERCC3</i> play an important role in benzene-induced epigenetic changes and whether the specific methylation patterns are associated with benzene hematotoxicity, we analyzed the promoter methylation levels of individual CpG sites, transcription factor binding motif and the correlation between aberrant CpG methylation and hematotoxicity in 76 benzene-exposed workers and 24 unexposed controls in China. Out of all the CpGs analyzed, two CpG units located 43 bp upstream and 99 bp downstream of the transcription start site of <i>ERCC3</i> (CpG 2-4 and CpG 17-18, respectively), showed the most pronounced increase in methylation levels in benzene-exposed workers, compared with unexposed controls (Mean ± SD: 5.86 ± 2.77% vs. 4.92 ± 1.53%, <i>p</i> = 0.032; 8.45 ± 4.09% vs. 6.79 ± 2.50%, <i>p</i> = 0.024, respectively).

For the in vitro experiment, four different types of cells are encapsulated in the desired compartments of sodium alginate MJMs and co-cultured for seven days. By increasing the number of coaxial needles, we are also able to produce MJMs with three or more compartments.

MMPs are produced and assembled in the cytoplasm as proenzymes with a cytoplasmic domain and require extracellular activation. MMPs can degrade receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, PARPs and release apoptotic substances. MMPs have been found in the cytosol, organelles and extracellular compartments and recently many types of MMPs have been found in the nucleus. However, the mechanisms and roles of MMPs inside the cell nucleus are still poorly understood. Here we summarized the nuclear localization mechanisms of MMPs and their functions in the nucleus such as apoptosis, tissue remodeling upon injury and cancer progression. Most importantly, we found that nuclear MMPs have evolved to translocate to membrane and target ECM possibly through evolution of nuclear localization signal (NLS), natural selection and anti-apoptotic survival. Thus, the knowledge about the evolution and regulation of nuclear MMPs appears to be essential in understanding a variety of cellular processes along with the development of MMP-targeted therapeutic drugs against the progression of certain diseases.</abstracttext>]",[]

The clinical translation and application of precision medicine - especially in the prevention and treatment of tumors - is far from satisfactory; however, the aims of precision medicine deserve approval. Thus, this medical approach is currently in its infancy; it has promising prospects, but it needs to overcome numbers of problems and deficiencies. It is expected that in addition to conventional symptoms and signs, precision medicine will define disease in terms of the underlying molecular characteristics and other environmental susceptibility factors. Those expectations should be realized by constructing a novel data network, integrating clinical data from individual patients and personal genomic background with existing research on the molecular makeup of diseases. In addition, multi-omics analysis and multi-discipline collaboration will become crucial elements in precision medicine.

EVs are membrane-surrounded structures released by cells in an evolutionarily conserved manner. EVs have gained much attention from both the basic and clinical research areas, as EVs appear to play a role in many diseases; however, the well-known case is cancer.

First, genes from different sources, including eukaryotic hosts via endosymbiotic gene transfer and bacteria via horizontal gene transfer, were combined to build a complete pathway framework. Then, a critical event occurred to drive these pathways to have real function: one of the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase homologs that arose by gene duplication subsequently adopted the function of the mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (MGP) gene, which was absent in algal genomes. Further, downstream pathway genes proceeded with gene expansions and complex transcriptional mechanisms, which may be conducive to the synthesis of alginate and fucoidan with diverse structures and contents depending on the developmental stage, tissue structure, and environmental conditions.

Subjects performed a sustained precision pinch at 10% maximum pinch force for 15 sec with the wrist stabilized at 30° extension, neutral, or 30° flexion using customized splints. The force discrepancy and the force coordination angle between the thumb and index finger forces were calculated, as well as the β-band (15-30 Hz) coherence between APB and FDI. The index finger applied greater force than the thumb (p &lt; 0.05); this force discrepancy was increased with wrist flexion (p &lt; 0.05), but was not affected by CTS (p &gt; 0.05). The directional force coordination was not significantly affected by wrist posture or CTS (p &gt; 0.05). In general, digit force coordination during precision pinch seems to be sensitive to wrist flexion, but is not affected by CTS.
